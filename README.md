# Stock Portfolio Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze sentiment data from social media sources to make informed decisions about stock portfolios. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, we extract sentiment signals from textual data and use them to predict stock market trends.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilize NLP techniques to analyze sentiment from social media posts, news articles, and other textual sources.
- **Stock Market Prediction**: Predict stock market trends based on sentiment analysis results and historical stock data.
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Optimize stock portfolios based on sentiment analysis insights and risk-return considerations.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for development.
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NLTK, spaCy**: Natural language processing libraries for sentiment analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for predictive modeling.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Visualization libraries for data exploration and presentation.
